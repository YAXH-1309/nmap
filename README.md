# 🛡️ Task 1: Scan Your Local Network for Open Ports

## 🎯 Objective
Learn to discover open ports on devices in your local network to understand network exposure and basic cybersecurity risks.

---

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- [`Nmap`](https://nmap.org/) – Network scanning and reconnaissance
- [`Wireshark`](https://www.wireshark.org/) *(optional)* – Packet analysis
- Kali Linux Terminal

## 📘 Concepts Learned

* Network reconnaissance using IP ranges (`/24`)
* TCP SYN scanning and open port enumeration
* Service identification and basic risk analysis
* Optional packet inspection with Wireshark
